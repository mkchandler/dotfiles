# mkchandler dotfiles

My configuration and setup files. Almost all of these originated from other people and were slightly adapted for my own use. I've provided a list below; please also check out each of their dotfiles for even more goodness. Please copy, fork, adapt, and use all these files!

## Credits

This is a partial list of some of my major sources. I have gathered many more items from others, but there would be too many to list and I honestly don't remember all of them. I recommend browsing GitHub for dotfiles repos to find more great setups besides the ones listed below.

- *[alkrauss48/dotfiles_plusplus](https://github.com/alkrauss48/dotfiles_plusplus)* - vim config, symlinks setup
- *[datachomp/dotfiles](https://github.com/datachomp/dotfiles)* - postgres config, brew installs
